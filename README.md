# Regression-Models

Hello,

This repo contains the project related to the Regression Models course from Coursera.

You will find the Rmd file that I have used to produce the PDF file (through Knitr) which presents the answers of the two questions asked.

This pdf respects the 5 pages limitations defined by the instructor and includes an executive summary, 2 pages of data exploratory analysis and conclusions, as well as an appendix containing only plots.

Have fun,

Philippe-C
